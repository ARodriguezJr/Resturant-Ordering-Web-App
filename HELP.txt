How to get Front End server up

Install Git Bash (https://gitforwindows.org/) - You need git Bash, but git Desktop will come with it too

Git Bash is similar to Linux CLI - change directory to the folder where you want the files to go into

Get code from github:
$ git clone https://github.com/ARodriguezJr/Resturant-Ordering-Web-App.git

From there you should be able to do:
$ node server.js

If not, download nodeJS (https://nodejs.org/en/download/) - Pick the windows or MacOS installer and right Architecture (32 or 64)

then try:
$ node server.js

If the console says something like "missing module node" or "missing module npm", do:

Use the global Search Charm to search "Environment Variables" (In settings)
Click "Edit system environment variables"
Click "Environment Variables" in the dialog.
In the "System Variables" box, search for Path and edit it to include C:\Program Files\nodejs. Make sure it is separated from any other paths by a ;.
You will have to restart any currently-opened command prompts before it will take effect.

server.js is the main file that boots up the server
