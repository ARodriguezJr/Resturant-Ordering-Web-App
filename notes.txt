Hey guys so I have been using Node JS in order to stand up the webservers we are using for the project. Since we wanted to use C++
to do the data interactions, I found this Node engine "V8" that could allow us to do that. Go ahead and check it out if you can, it's
just another idea for us on how we can transfer data to the C++ program

If the code is changed from c++ to javascript. Here are some examples on js server and client.
